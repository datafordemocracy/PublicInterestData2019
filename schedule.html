        <h1>Lab Schedule</h1>
        <p>The schedule becomes more tentative as the project progresses. We’ll spend more time at the beginning learning more about the context, policies, and operations of the foster care system, along with attention to what it means to do data science in the public interest. In the latter half of the class, most of our time will be spent working with the data, solving problems, and writing the report.</p>
        <h3>2/15 The Child Welfare System & Foster Care, Learning by Doing, Data as Power</h3>
        <blockquote>For apart from inquiry apart from the praxis, individuals cannot be truly human. Knowledge emerges only through invention and re-invention, through the restless, impatient, continuing, hopeful inquiry, human beings pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other.
        – Paulo Freire, Pedagogy of the Oppressed</blockquote><br>

        <h3>2/22 State and Local Context, Data Provenance and Ethics</h3>
        <blockquote>Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.

        <h3> 3/1 Embedded Disparity, Models and Race</h3>
        <blockquote>The oppressor is in solidarity with the oppressed only when he stops regarding the oppressed as an abstract category and sees them as persons who have been unjustly dealt with, deprived of their voice, cheated in the sale of their labor - when he stops making pious, sentimental, and individualistic gestures and risks an act of love. True solidarity is found only in the plenitude of this act of love, in its existentiality in its praxis. To affirm that men and women are persons and as persons should be free, and yet to do nothing tangible to make this affirmation a reality, is a farce.

        <blockquote>If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.
