        <h1>Lab Schedule</h1>
        <p>The schedule becomes more tentative as the project progresses. We’ll spend more time at the beginning learning more about the context, policies, and operations of the foster care system, along with attention to what it means to do data science in the public interest. In the latter half of the class, most of our time will be spent working with the data, solving problems, and writing the report.</p>
        <h3>2/15 The Child Welfare System & Foster Care, Learning by Doing, Data as Power</h3>
        <blockquote>For apart from inquiry apart from the praxis, individuals cannot be truly human. Knowledge emerges only through invention and re-invention, through the restless, impatient, continuing, hopeful inquiry, human beings pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other.
        – Paulo Freire, Pedagogy of the Oppressed</blockquote><br>

        <h3>2/22 Local Context, Data Provenance and Ethics</h3>
        <blockquote>Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.

        <h3> 3/1 State Context, Data Provenance and Processing</h3>
        <blockquote>The oppressor is in solidarity with the oppressed only when he stops regarding the oppressed as an abstract category and sees them as persons who have been unjustly dealt with, deprived of their voice, cheated in the sale of their labor - when he stops making pious, sentimental, and individualistic gestures and risks an act of love. True solidarity is found only in the plenitude of this act of love, in its existentiality in its praxis. To affirm that men and women are persons and as persons should be free, and yet to do nothing tangible to make this affirmation a reality, is a farce.
        – Paulo Freire, Pedagogy of the Oppressed</blockquote><br>

        <h3>3/15 Spring Break</h3>

        <h3>3/22 Foster Care Research, Data as Political</h3>
        <blockquote>But simply punishing the broken--walking away from them or hiding them from sight--only ensures that they remain broken and we do, too. There is no wholeness outside of our reciprocal humanity.

        </ul>

        <h3>3/29, Data Wrangling, Foster Care Stories</h3>
        <blockquote>... as the philosopher spoke of the great American [Lincoln] "who was content merely to dig the channels through which the moral life of his countrymen might flow," I was gradually able to make a natural connection between this intellectual penetration at Oxford and the moral perception which is always necessary for the discovery of new methods by which to minister to human needs. In the unceasing ebb and flow of justice and oppression we must all dig channels as best we may, that at the propitious moment somewhat of the swelling tide may be conducted to the barren places of life.

        <h3>4/5, 4/12, 4/19, 4/26 Data Analysis, Visualization, & Communication</h3>
        <blockquote>The only dream worth having is to dream that you will live while you are alive, and die only when you are dead. To love, to be loved. To never forget your own insignificance. To never get used to the unspeakable violence and vulgar disparity of the life around you. To seek joy in the saddest places. To pursue beauty to its lair. To never simplify what is complicated or complicate what is simple. To respect strength, never power. Above all to watch. To try and understand. To never look away. And never, never to forget.
          ― Arundhati Roy, The Algebra of Infinite Justice</blockquote><br>
